## about me

<p class="description">
I am <b>Web Developer</b> with around <b>two years</b> of professional experience. My main  <b>expertise is back-end development</b>. I have experienced with <b>Ruby on Rails</b> (and <b>Sidekiq</b>!), <b>PostgreSQL</b> and <b>AWS</b>. I have also dabbled with <b>Java Spring Boot</b> from my university studies ;) With front-end development, I have used <b>ReactJS</b> (and learnt <b>Redux</b> along the way) to build a portfolio website. I have also wrote a native mobile application in <b>Swift</b>. 
<br/>
<br/>
I <b>try not to limit myself to a particular stack or technology</b> though. My principle is to <b>master the fundamental concepts</b> that these frameworks/ languages have in common so that it would be easier for me to switch from one tool to another. I think it is more interesting that way. 
<br/>

<!-- This does not mean that I do not have preferences. Language-wise, <b>I like Golang</b> because of the syntax (having used both Java and Ruby, I think it is a happy middle ground) and the cute Gopher mascot. <b>Spring Boot is my favourite framework</b> because the common use cases are covered nicely.  -->
